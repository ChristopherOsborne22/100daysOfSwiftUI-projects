# 100daysOfSwiftUI-projects
This is my workspace for 19 projects on 100 Days of SwifUI by Paul Hudson (link: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). 
This is where I will show my best efforts at completing the projects and challenges presented by Paul Hudson.
And, if possible, I will add some of my touches to make the projects look more me-like.

As Paul Hudson has always reminded me not to do this learning journey alone and I should tell everyone about it, this Github repository is my attempt at doing so.
And, I have really high hope in myself that I will complete all these 19 projects. Wish me luck and perseverance! Thank you!
